/// Manages heartbeat timeout detection for plant actors.
///
/// This manager tracks pending heartbeat requests and detects when responses
/// do not arrive within the configured timeout period. It is used internally
/// by plant actors to monitor connection health when heartbeat responses are
/// enabled via `return_heartbeat_response(false)`.
///
/// ## Behavior
///
/// - Tracks at most one pending heartbeat at a time
/// - If a new heartbeat is sent before the previous one times out or responds,
///   the previous pending heartbeat is replaced (a warning is logged)
/// - Timeout detection is performed in the plant's tokio select! loop
/// - When a timeout occurs, a `HeartbeatTimeout` error is sent to subscribers
///
/// ## Timeout Configuration
///
/// The timeout duration is set to 30 seconds by default (`HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT_SECS`),
/// which is half the heartbeat interval (60 seconds). This provides a reasonable
/// balance between detecting connection issues and avoiding false positives from
/// transient network delays.
