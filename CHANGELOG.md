## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.1]

### Added

#### Connection Error Handling
- **New `RithmicMessage::ConnectionError` variant** for WebSocket connection failures
  - Provides unified error handling for all connection-related failures
  - Enables consumers to implement reconnection logic via pattern matching
  - Includes comprehensive documentation with examples
- **Comprehensive WebSocket error detection** across all plants (ticker, order, pnl, history):
  - `ConnectionClosed`: Normal WebSocket closure
  - `AlreadyClosed`: Attempted use of closed connection
  - `Io` errors: Network/socket I/O failures (connection lost, timeout)
  - `ResetWithoutClosingHandshake`: Connection reset without proper WebSocket close
  - `SendAfterClosing`: Attempted to send data after closing frame sent
  - `ReceivedAfterClosing`: Received data after closing frame sent
- **Automatic error notifications** sent through subscription channel when connection fails
  - `RithmicResponse` with `message: ConnectionError` and `is_update: true`
  - `error` field contains specific error description
  - `source` field identifies which plant failed
  - Enables consumers to detect and handle connection failures in real-time

#### Documentation
- Added comprehensive documentation to `RithmicMessage::ConnectionError`
  - Lists all handled error types
  - Step-by-step guidance for handling connection errors
  - Complete code examples showing pattern matching
  - Notes on behavioral details and channel lifecycle
- Added detailed documentation to `RithmicResponse` struct
  - Explains error handling for both protocol and connection errors
  - Examples showing how to handle different error scenarios
  - Cross-references to related documentation

### Changed
- **Improved logging consistency**: Changed `ConnectionClosed` log level from `info!` to `error!` across all plants
  - Ensures all connection termination events are logged at error level
  - Makes connection issues more visible in production logs
- Replace `event!` macro with specific logging macros (`info!`, `error!`, `warn!`) across library code for better code clarity and idiomatic Rust logging
  - Updated: all plant files, `src/api/receiver_api.rs`, `src/request_handler.rs`

### Fixed
- **Connection error handling**: Plants now properly stop and notify consumers on all WebSocket connection failures
  - Previously, most connection errors fell through to catch-all warning and left plants in undefined state
  - Now all connection errors trigger clean shutdown with error notification
  - Prevents resource leaks and zombie plant instances

## [0.5.0]

> **📖 Migration Guide:** See [MIGRATION_0.5.0.md](MIGRATION_0.5.0.md) for detailed step-by-step migration instructions.

### Breaking Changes

#### Connection API Changes
- **Plant constructors renamed**: `new()` → `connect()` across all plants
- **Return type changed**: `connect()` now returns `Result<Plant, Box<dyn std::error::Error>>`
- **Required parameter**: All plants now require a `ConnectStrategy` parameter
- Enables proper error handling instead of panics and explicit connection strategy selection

#### Configuration API Changes
- **New unified configuration**: `RithmicConfig` replaces separate account/connection info types
  - Old types (`AccountInfo`, `RithmicConnectionInfo`, `RithmicConnectionSystem`) are deprecated
  - Migration path provided via `From`/`TryFrom` trait implementations
- **Environment handling**: `RithmicEnv` replaces `RithmicConnectionSystem`
  - More idiomatic enum naming
  - Better integration with configuration builder

#### Error Handling Changes
- **Heartbeat error visibility**: Heartbeat responses now delivered through subscription channel
  - `ResponseHeartbeat` changed from `is_update: false` → `is_update: true`
  - Consumers must check `error` field on heartbeat responses to detect connection issues
  - Breaking for applications that assumed heartbeats wouldn't appear in subscriptions
- **Forced logout events**: Now delivered through subscription channel for visibility
  - `ForcedLogout` changed from `is_update: false` → `is_update: true`
  - Applications must handle forced logout events to implement reconnection logic
- **No more panics**: Error responses from server no longer panic, sent to subscription channel instead

### Added

#### Connection Strategies
- New `ConnectStrategy` enum with three modes:
  - **`Simple`**: Single connection attempt (recommended default, fast-fail)
  - **`Retry`**: Indefinite retries with exponential backoff on same URL
  - **`AlternateWithRetry`**: Alternates between primary and beta URLs with retries
- Retry strategies now retry indefinitely instead of limiting to 15 attempts
- Maximum backoff capped at 60 seconds to ensure at most one login attempt per minute
- Prevents excessive load on Rithmic servers during extended outages

#### Unified Configuration API
- `RithmicConfig`: Modern, ergonomic configuration type combining account and connection fields
- `RithmicEnv`: Environment selection enum (Demo, Live, Test)
- `ConfigError`: Type-safe error handling for configuration operations
- `from_env()`: Load configuration from environment variables with proper error handling
- `from_dotenv()`: Load configuration from .env file (requires `dotenv` feature)
- `RithmicConfigBuilder`: Builder pattern for programmatic configuration
- Comprehensive unit tests (15 tests) covering all configuration scenarios

#### Connection Health Monitoring
- Heartbeat responses now include error information in subscription channel
- Forced logout events delivered through subscription channel
- Applications can monitor connection health in real-time
- Examples added showing proper heartbeat timeout tracking

#### Documentation
- Comprehensive documentation for connection strategies
- Connection timeout and retry behavior documented
- Migration guide for deprecated types in `connection_info` module
- Real-world examples showing proper error handling and connection monitoring
- Examples updated to demonstrate new unified configuration API

### Fixed

#### Critical Panic Fixes
- Fixed panic on unknown message types by adding proper error handling (#3)
  - Unknown message types now logged and gracefully handled
  - Added `UnknownMessage` variant to handle unexpected protocol messages
- Fixed panic on error responses in ticker plant (#2)
  - Error responses from `buf_to_message()` now handled gracefully
  - Errors sent through subscription channel for consumer handling
- Fixed panic on heartbeat errors across all plants
  - Broadcast send errors now handled gracefully instead of unwrapping
  - No more crashes on channel receiver drops

#### Consistency Fixes
- Fixed inconsistent heartbeat logic across plants (#9)
  - All plants (ticker, order, pnl, history) now only send heartbeats after login
  - Prevents protocol violations from pre-login heartbeats
  - Unified behavior across all plant implementations
- Fixed MessageType decode unwrap with proper error handling (#4)
  - Removed `.unwrap()` calls in message decoding
  - Proper error propagation through Result types

#### Code Quality
- Removed `#[allow(dead_code)]` annotations from valid public API methods (#11)
  - `request_new_order`, `request_exit_position`, `request_show_brackets`, `request_show_bracket_stops`
  - Added comprehensive documentation for these public API methods
  - Improved library API clarity

### Deprecated

The following types are deprecated and will be removed in a future version:
- `AccountInfo` - Use `RithmicConfig` instead
- `RithmicConnectionInfo` - Use `RithmicConfig` instead
- `RithmicConnectionSystem` - Use `RithmicEnv` instead
- `get_config()` function - Use `RithmicConfig::from_env()` or builder pattern

Migration helpers provided via trait implementations maintain backward compatibility.

### Changed

#### API Consistency
- Unified error handling pattern across all plants
  - Consistent routing based on `is_update` flag
  - Simplified message handling logic
  - No panics in production code

#### Internal Improvements
- Updated `RithmicSenderApi` to use `RithmicConfig` and `RithmicEnv`
- Simplified routing logic using `is_update` flag instead of message type checks
- Improved type safety by replacing panics with proper error types

### Migration Guide

For detailed migration instructions with code examples, see **[MIGRATION_0.5.0.md](MIGRATION_0.5.0.md)**.

Quick summary:
- Replace `Plant::new()` → `Plant::connect(&config, strategy)`
- Replace `AccountInfo` → `RithmicConfig::from_env()` or builder pattern
- Choose `ConnectStrategy` (Simple/Retry/AlternateWithRetry)
- Add error handling for heartbeats and forced logouts in subscription channel

### Future Plans

- Remove `dotenv` dependency - move to optional feature (planned for 0.6.0)
  - Configuration will work without .env files by default
  - `from_dotenv()` will require opt-in feature flag
  - Reduces mandatory dependencies for library users
